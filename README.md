## Work Experience
**Data Scientist and Project Coordinator @ Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Germany (2023 - Present_)**
- EU Project: Development of non-aversive stunning methods of pigs (Pigstun)
- Research and analysis of data, planning and management of project

**Post Doctoral Research fellow  @ University Hospital Greifswald (2020 - 2022)**
- DFG-Project: Influence of ChREBP transcription factor, glycogen and glycogen-associated
proteins in experimental and human hepatocarcinogenesis.
Research Aims:
- Investigation of glycogen-associated proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line; HepG2.
- Is ChREBP an essential inducer of lipogenesis and glycolysis in the context of NAFLD or NASH.
- Immune microenvironment study and its role in NASH-driven liver damage and HCC.
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes
** PhD Research fellow  @ University Hospital Essen (2015 - 2019)**
  BMBF Project: Regulated systems of ISce-I expression for in-depth studies of the biological effects of DSBs and DSB clusters.
  DFG Project: C-terminal-binding protein interacting protein (CtIP) promotes alternative end joining (alt-EJ) in cells exposed to irradiation.
